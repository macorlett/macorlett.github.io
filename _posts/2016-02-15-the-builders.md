My dad has always been a big poety fan so for his birthday I wrote him a small piece about him and I.<!-- excerpt ends -->

Poety has always been something I’ve wanted to dabble in but only when the time feels right. when I truely have something to say. this was one of those times.

> When I'd struggle to find the words,  
you would offer your pen.  
Swords in hand,  
We'd wage war on the page.  
You would listen,  
I would draw,  
together we would create worlds.  
Now I wage my own wars,  
Fueled by passion, we both shared.
Though words still escape me,
that universe still grows.  
The page, it's window.   
The pen, it's sword.  
I, it's creator.
