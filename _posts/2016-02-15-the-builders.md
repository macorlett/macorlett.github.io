### A short piece about my dad on his birthday.<!-- excerpt ends -->

When I'd struggle to find the words,  
you would offer your pen.  
Swords in hand,  
We'd wage war on the page.  
You would listen,  
I would draw,  
together we would create worlds.  
Now I wage my own wars,  
Fueled by passion, we both shared.   
Though words still escape me,   
that universe still grows.  
The page, it's window.   
The pen, it's sword.  
I, it's creator.

Laptop update: It's all be fixed up now so no more worries. Everything is back and in good working order. The only thing that needed replacing was the fans, basically the ballbarings in the right fan were crapping out..
