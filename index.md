Hi I'm Michael, but everyone calls me Mike. I specialize in designing websites and online user experiences. In my opinion usability trumps everything else when it comes to the web. Provide your users with an awesome experience and they keep coming back. Plain and simple. Follow that up with great design as well as a sweet product and sky's the limit :)

Another one of my passions is illustration. Whether its icons, branding or infographics I love it all! I've recently started posting a bit of it on <a href="https://dribbble.com/macorlett" target="_blank">Dribbble</a> if you are keen on checking it out.
