<h1>I want to get better</h1>

<h3 id="and-ill-start-with-the-only-way-i-know-how">And I’ll start with the only way I know how.</h3>

<p>Writing has always been tuff for me, ever since I was a kid. While others around me picked it up with ease, letters and words were something my brain just didn’t comprehend.<!-- excerpt ends --> Though never diagnosed my parents choked it up to mostly like a case of dyslexia. still, to this day I often struggle with it, though it’s not so bad considering most everything has inbuilt spell check.</p>

<p>So yes, I want to get better at writing, so I figure the only way to do that is the same way I’ve come to deal with my dyslexia. write more! No it’s not any new kind of revelation. In fact, most writers will tell you that writing is the only way to get better, and it’s true. The more you do a thing, the better you will become at said thing. In a way, I guess that’s why I started this blog. To write and receive feedback, to share my opinions and start conversations. Conversations I think are worth having. And of course, to get better.</p>

<p>With that said, this is how I’m going to do it. From here on out I’ll try and write something every day and post it to this blog. In all likely hood it will not be perfect, but that’s ok. Nothing’s ever perfect anyway. Things can always do with further improvement, and with time, it’ll get there. But in saying that if I have royally fucked up somewhere along the line please let me know. As a designer, I well accustomed to criticism and like to know when I’m wrong. That’s one of the ways I get better.</p>

<p>So for now thats it. Thanks for hanging out and perhaps I’ll catch you later :)</p>
