### With a new blog comes new responsiblity.

So here we are. This should be interesting. I've finally gotten round to getting this website into a state in which I feel happy enough to start publishing artciles. On top of that I have now made the efford to find time and actually write stuff, which is good. Well it's good for me anyway.

Now with that said, what is it that you can expect from me and this website? My plan is to write about anything and everything that I want to have a discusion about. I'm a Designer and Illustrator by trade so expect articles relate to those fields to pop up a lot. But also on top of that I'd like this to be a place where I can speak my mind about whatever currently sparks my interest. Weither thats a cool new place I've found, upcoming travel plans, bullshit my friends are going on about, general day to day troubles, the lot.

So If I've sparked your interest then welcome! And I look forward to chating with you soon. To everyone else, thanks for dropping by and hopefully we will meet again some time in the future :)
