<p>So here we are. This should be interesting. I’ve finally gotten round to getting this website into a state that I’m reasonably happy with. Happy enough to start writing articles anyway. <!-- excerpt ends --> On top of that, I have now made the effort to find the time and actually write stuff, which is good.</p>

<p>Now with that said, what is it that you can expect from me and this website? My plan is to write about anything and everything that I want to have a discussion about. I’m a Designer and Illustrator by trade so expect articles relate to those fields to pop up a lot. But also, on top of that, I’d like this to be a place where I can what’s on my mind. Whether that’s a cool new place, upcoming travel, general day to day troubles, the lot.</p>

<p>So If I’ve sparked your interest then welcome! And I look forward to chatting with you soon. To everyone else, thanks for dropping by and hopefully we will meet again sometime in the future :)</p>
