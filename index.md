Hi all! the names Michael but everyone calls me Mike (even though mum doesn't like it).
I'm currently working at <a href="http://zingdesign.com" target="_blank">Zing Design</a> and
have been for the last 2 years as a web designer and lead illustrator. I've taken on projects
for a number of clients including RaboDirect, Spark, Raygun.io and STQRY.

I plan to using this website as my ever evloving portfolio and place to share any future
projects I endver to take on during my free time.
