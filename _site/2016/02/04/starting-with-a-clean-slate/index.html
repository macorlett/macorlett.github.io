<h1>Starting with a clean slate</h1>

<h3 id="with-a-new-blog-comes-new-responsiblity">With a new blog comes new responsiblity.</h3>

<p>So here we are. This should be interesting. I’ve finally gotten round to getting this website into a state in which I feel happy enough to start publishing artciles. On top of that I have now made the efford to find time and actually write stuff, which is good. Well it’s good for me anyway.</p>

<p>Now with that said, what is it that you can expect from me and this website? My plan is to write about anything and everything that I want to have a discusion about. I’m a Designer and Illustrator by trade so expect articles relate to those fields to pop up a lot. But also on top of that I’d like this to be a place where I can speak my mind about whatever currently sparks my interest. Weither thats a cool new place I’ve found, upcoming travel plans, bullshit my friends are going on about, general day to day troubles, the lot.</p>

<p>So If I’ve sparked your interest then welcome! And I look forward to chating with you soon. To everyone else, thanks for dropping by and hopefully we will meet again some time in the future :)</p>
